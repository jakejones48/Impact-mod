Dont need a defualt biome number


set each chunk as 0 and when it suppares a given interval such as 100, then change the biomes in the chunk
make the change number configuratble so that you can change the speed of its change

remember 
event.getChunk().setBiomeArray(bytearray)

Try to get a biome list on startup
arragne these based on tempreture into a list
with ids to change between them
